# Benefits of cloud computing

Cloud computing can use as much or as little of cloud services as they need. It does not need to be a full switch from on-prem to on cloud. A new company might start with all their infrastructure in the cloud, whereas an existing business - like Lloyds Bank - may choose to gradually move infrastructure to the cloud (also known as "lift and shift").

Benefits of cloud computing:

## Scalable

- Increasing or decreasing resources based on demand or workload
- Vertical and horizontal scaling

Vertical scaling (also known as "scaling up") is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Example, add more CPU's or add more memory to your server.

Horizontal scaling (also known as "scaling out") is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit. Example, adding more servers to process requests.

Scaling can be done manually or automatically based on triggers. Example, a trigger to start vertical scaling could be invoked when CPU utilization hits a certain threshold.

## Elastic

Similar to scaling, your workload can change due to a spike or drop in demand - a cloud computing system can compensate by automatically adding or removing resources.

Example, you website is featured in a magazine and suddenly gets a huge spike in traffic. Since cloud is elastic it automatically allocates more resources to handle the increase in traffic and then scales back down afterwards.

## Up-to-date

Cloud takes care of maintaining software patches, hardware setup, upgrades etc

If a hard disk fails then the cloud provider will take care of it. If new hardware is available the cloud provider will replace your hardware for you.

## Global

Cloud providers have a global network of datacenters which in turn gives you a local presence close to your customers to give them the best response time no matter where they are located.

You can replicate your services into multiple regions for redundancy and locality. Or choose a specific region to ensure you meet data compliance laws for your customers.

## Secure

On-prem is physically secure - building access is limited to certain people, and the same for operating on server racks etc

You also have digital security - who can connect to your systems and data over the network.

Cloud providers have better security than most organizations. This is achieved via a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technical skills.

All of this is to protect an organizations data, apps and infrastructure from threats.

Cloud providers have high physical and digital security to protect their datacenters as well. They also provide tools that allow organizations to mitigate security threats.
