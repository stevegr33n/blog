# Azure support options

Basically you got 3 options here

- Free support
- Paid support
- Community support

Free support is like https://docs.microsoft.com/ and the azure youtube channel. Tons of stuff here.

Paid support has many support plans to choose from. Professional direct is the best plan, it's aimed at business critical workloads. It gives 1hr response times and priority tracking of critical cases and access to an advanced pool of technial experts.

Theres also Standard which is meant for production workloads, and a developer plan which is meant for dev related stuff and much slower response times.

Commuinty support is like Stackoverflow and Azure Forums and Twitter.
