# Tour of Azure services

We on tour boys

Here's the main categories of what services Azure offers:

- Compute Services
- Cloud Storage
- Networking
- App Hosting
- AI
- IoT
- Integration
- Security

## Compute Services

This covers VMs, containers, and serverless computing which includes microservices.

These services are for running apps, executing programs and performing calculations.

This is one of the main reasons why companies start using Azure.

Example services:

- Service Fabric - a distributed systems platform
- Azure Batch - a managed service for paralell, high performance computing
- Azure functions - an event driven, serverless compute service
- Azure Kubernetes - a service that enables management of a cluster of VMs that run containerized services

...plus loads more!

## Cloud Storage

This includes disks attached to VMs, as well as DBs or file shares. All of which can expand and shrink as needed.

Example services:

- Blob Storage - store big ass objects like video files or bitmaps
- File Storage - File share that can be accessed like a file server
- Queue Storage - A data store for queueing and reliably delivering message between apps
- Table storage - A NoSQL store that hosts unstructured data independent of a scheme

...plus loads more!

Azure has basically unlimited storage for all of these services **AND** they are encrypted and have role-based access control (RBAC) **AND** highly available with redundancy **AND** they're managed for you.

## Networking

This covers private network connections to your on-prem environments. And the configuration and control of traffic into and out of Azure efficiently.

Networking tools also help your applications have high performance and scalability.

Example services:

- Azure Virtual Network - Connects VMs to incoming VPN connections
- Azure Load Balancer - Balances inbound and outbound connections to apps or service endpoints
- Azure DNS - ultra fast DNS responses
- Azure CDN - delivers high-bandwidth to customers on a global scale
- Azure Traffic Manager - distributes traffic across Azure regions

... plus loads more!

## App Hosting

This allows you to run your entire app on a managed platform. This platform can be running a Windows OS or Linux OS under the hood. You could also grab a 3rd party app from the Azure marketplace and run that app on App Hosting.

Example services:

- Azure App Service - create cloud web-based apps
- Azure Notification Hubs - Send push notifications to any platform from any backend
- APIM - Publish APIs to developers, partners, and employees securely at scale

... plus loads more!

## AI

This also includes machine learning and pre-built cognitive services.

These services help you search and analyse existing data, this will allow you to predict outcomes and trends.

You can then use your predicted outcomes and trends to make your apps and services smarter.

### Big Data

Thought I'd quickly mention Big Data here - big data is literally massively huge volumes of data that are so big that traditional forms of processing are no longer appropriate. This comes from stuff like, weather systems or imaging platforms.

Example services:

- Azure Synapse Analytics - Run Analytics at a massive scale using massive parallel processing (MPP) to run complex queries across **petabytes** of data

... plus loads more!

## IoT

Azure allows you to integrate sensors and devices, and manage them with IoT hubs. You can then create dashboards for these hubs to monitor and control your devices.

## Integration

Logic Apps and Service Bus connect your apps and services.

This allows you to create workflows to orchestrate your business processes. It doesn't matter if your apps and services are on-prem or in the cloud.

## Security

Azure has global security intelligence monitoring. Azure is super duper secure basically.

Theres also Azure Identity Management which gives you control over who has access to what service and the data in it.

### Devops

Also thought I'd quickly add devops to this list; DevOps brings together processes, technology, and automating software delivery.

Azure DevOps Services allow you to make Build & Release pipelines thate have continuous integration, delivery and deployment for your apps.

We can also work with 3rd party tools like Jenkins and Chef (though Chef is apparently redundant now)
