# Understand Geographies in Azure

Azure divided the whole globe into _geographies_ that are defined by country borders. This division has the following benefits:

- If you need your data to reside in a specific country for compliance you can have that (data residency)
- Geographies ensure data sovereignty, resiliency are honoroed within the geographical boundary
- Geographies are also fault tolerant and withstand complete region failure

Data residency refers to the geographic location of an organization's data.

These are the geographies:

- Americas
- Europe
- Asia Pacific
- Middle East & Africa

Each geography has regions as mentioned in the previous page.
