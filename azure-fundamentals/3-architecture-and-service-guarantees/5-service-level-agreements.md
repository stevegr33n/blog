# Understand Service-Level Agreements for Azure

Service-Level agreements (SLAs) are basically a set of standards that Microsoft commits to for its customers.

It basically means the service is gonna be of a certain standard - it should be high quality.

SLAs do not usually apply to the Free tier services though.

SLAs generally have 3 characteristics

- Performance targets
- Uptime Guarantees
- Service credits

## Performance Targets

An SLA will define a performance target for a product or service provided by Azure.

These targets are specific to the service, like a gauranteed uptime of 99% for example.

The SLA for uptime ranges from 99% - 99.999%

## Service credits

SLAs also describe how Microsoft will respond if an Azure product or service fails to perform.

This may be a discount applied to the customers Azure bill as compensation.

If the uptime is less than 99% then you'd get 25 credits, if it's less than 95% you'd get 100 credits.
